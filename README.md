# Phase 3 Project 

## Project Intentions

 An interactive webiste  that uses web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction
Throughout the Pokemon games, the end of every game come down to whether or not you are able to defeat the strongest trainers in each region, known as the Elite Four/Champion.

Since this requires you to face the most difficult trainers, this website displays information about each trainer such as their individual pokemon and their statistics.This includes the Trainers' region, typing, and their general popularity. As for their pokemon, we also list their respective level as well as their typing.  Trainers and their pokemon are joined together through an one to many association using Active Record. 
We then use Sinatra as our backend to respond to requests sent from the browser. 

## Resources Used

For this project, you must:

-Active Record
-Ruby
-React 
-Sinatra



### Additional Applications

In addition to reviewing individual trainers and their respective Pokemon, we also showcase POST,PATCH, and DELETE capabilities within the webiste. 
You can create a new individual trainer with some background information, as well as, adding a new Pokemon associated with that trainer. 

Normally you can delete trainers as you please as well as change things such as their respective popularity.
